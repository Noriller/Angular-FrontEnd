  <h1 mat-dialog-title>
    Hi, my name is Bruno and this is my portfolio website made in Angular with Angular Material.
  </h1>

  <div mat-dialog-content>
    What I did in here?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Authentication and session management (just please, don't put sensitive
        information, I'm still not confident in the security details.)
        <div class="textWithLeftMargin">
          By entering with "admin/{{ "{" }}username{{ "}" }}", you will be
          redirected to an admin panel where you can insert new "products".
        </div>
        <div class="textWithLeftMargin">
          Be aware that after about 5 minutes from the last insertion, the
          database will automatically reset.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>You can browse the "products" and finish a "transaction".</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div mat-dialog-actions class="buttonContainer">
    <button mat-button [mat-dialog-close]="data" cdkFocusInitial>Close</button>
    <mat-checkbox
      [(ngModel)]="data"
      labelPosition="before">
      Don't show it again:
    </mat-checkbox>
  </div>
