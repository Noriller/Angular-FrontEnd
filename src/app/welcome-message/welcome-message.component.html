<div>
  <h1 mat-dialog-title>
    Hi, my name is Bruno and this is my portfolio website made in Angular with Angular Material.
  </h1>

  <div mat-dialog-content>
    What I did in here?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Authentication and session management (just please, don't put sensitive
        information, I'm still not confident in the security details.)
        <div class="TextWithLeftMargin">
          By entering with "admin/{{ "{" }}username{{ "}" }}", you will be
          redirected to an admin panel where you can insert new "products".
        </div>
        <div class="TextWithLeftMargin">
          Be aware that after about 5 minutes from the last insertion, the
          database will automatically reset.
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>You can browse the "products" and finish a "transaction".</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div mat-dialog-actions>
    <button mat-button mat-dialog-close>Close</button>
  </div>
</div>
